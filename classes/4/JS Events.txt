1. JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.

When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

Developers can use these events to execute JavaScript coded responses, which cause buttons to close windows, messages to be displayed to users, data to be validated, and virtually any other type of response imaginable.

HTML or DOM events are widely used in JavaScript code. JavaScript code is executed with HTML/DOM events.


a. onclick:
----------- It is used event type which occurs when a user clicks the left button of his mouse. You can put your validation, warning etc., against this event type.


b. onmouseover and onmouseout:
------------------------------ These two event types will help you create nice effects with images or even with text as well. The onmouseover event triggers when you bring your mouse over any element and the onmouseout triggers when you move your mouse out from that element. 



c. onsubmit:
------------ it is an event that occurs when you try to submit a form. You can put your form validation against this event type.



d. onload:
----------- Execute a JavaScript immediately after a page has been loaded. The onload attribute fires when an object has been loaded.

onload is most often used within the <body> element to execute a script once a web page has completely loaded all content (including images, script files, CSS files, etc.). 


e. onblur:
----------  The onblur event occurs when an object loses focus.

The onblur event is most often used with form validation code (e.g. when the user leaves a form field).


f. onfocus:
----------- The onfocus event is the opposite of the onblur event. The onfocus event occurs when an element gets focus.

The onfocus event is most often used with <input>, <select>, and <a>
