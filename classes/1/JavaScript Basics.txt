1. Variable: is simply a name of storage location
	two types: local and global variables
There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).

a. Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
b. After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
c. JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.

Ex:
 <html>
<body>
<script>  
var x = 10;  
var y = 20;  
var z=x+y;  
document.write(z);  
</script>  
</body>
</html>

Output: 30


2. JS Local VAriable: A JavaScript local variable is declared inside block or function. It is accessible within the function or block only

<script>  
function abc(){  
var x=10;//local variable  
}  
</script>  


3. JS Global Variable: A JavaScript global variable is accessible from any function. A variable i.e. declared outside the function or declared with window object is known as global variable. For example:

<html>
<body>
<script>  
var data=200;//gloabal variable  
function a(){  
document.writeln(data);  
}  
function b(){  
document.writeln(data);  
}  
a();//calling JavaScript function
b();
  
</script>  
</body>
</html>


Output: 200 200


4. A JavaScript global variable is declared outside the function or declared with window object. It can be accessed from any function.

To declare JavaScript global variables inside function, you need to use window object. For example:

<html>
<body>
<script>
function m(){  
window.value=100;//declaring global variable by window object  
}  
function n(){  
alert(window.value);//accessing global variable from other function  
}  
m();
n();
</script>
</body>
</html>


Note: When you declare a variable outside the function, it is added in the window object internally. You can access it through window object also.

var value=50;  
function a(){  
alert(window.value);//accessing global variable   
}  



5. Data types: JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine

JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

a. Primitive data type
b. Non-primitive (reference) data type

var a=40;//holding number  
var b="Rahul";//holding string  


JS Primitive Data types: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null
JS Non-primitive data types: Object, Array, RegExp


6. Operators: JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands
Ex: var sum=10+20;

Ex: var a = x*y;
